# Titanic
Analysis of the Titanic Dataset (available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

# Description
This is a project I did in my spare time - I had never worked on the Titanic dataset before, and thought I'd check it out. I've done some Exploratory Data Analysis, data manipulation, and machine learning.
